//Swift Collection View Cat Puzzle Part1 Lab
//To Avoid reading problem with hints/partial solution

1. SET UP THE  COLLECTION VIEW CONTROLLER IN INTERFACE BUILDER

2. CREATE A SUBCLASS OF UICOLLECTIONVIEWCONTROLLER  NAME IT COLLECTIONVIEWCONTROLLER

3. ADD THE REQUIRED DATASOURCE METHODS   - return 12 for items., name cell Identifier as “puzzleCell” ,  make background color purple.

Build and run the application.

4. ADD A SUBCLASS OF UICOLLECTIONVIEWCELL
An image view could be added to the cell directly inside of collectionView(_:cellForItemAt:)but a better approach is to subclass a UICollectionViewCell. This way the subclass can handle all the functionality that only relates to the cell. This approach is more organized and scalable.

Build and run the application. You should see 12 repeating cat pictures.
